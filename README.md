News Homepage Main javascript Junior challenge from Frontend Mentor. My first time doing a grid inside a grid. 
Learn a new way to use box shadow, when clicked in the mobile size hamburger menu, everything else gets darken except the header links menu. 
Also, this is my first time using Javascript and CSS animations together, I had fun with this one but still took me a lot of time to complete it. I try also writing better documentation, I'd love to hear if it's still confusing and how can I improve it. 
Looking forward to keep practicing my Javascript. Thanks Frontend Mentor and the Frontend community.
